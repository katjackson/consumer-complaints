This is a simple data analysis on a large set of data from the CFPB Consumer Complaint Database. You'll see that I created a Pandas DataFrame of all of the important data that includes easy-to-manage date-time formating and clear column names. Now complaints DataFrame can easily be organized and plotted by company, product, resolution, and more.
