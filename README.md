## Plotting Consumer Complaints using Panda

This repository contains a large set of data from the CFPB Consumer Complaint Database that has been analyzed and plotted using the Pandas module. 'complaints_dec_2014.csv' contains the data.

### Plots and Analysis
All of the plots and analysis are contained in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/katjackson/consumer-complaints/blob/master/consumer-complaints.ipynb). Take a look! You'll see that I created a DataFrame of all of the important data that includes easy-to-manage date-time formating and clear column names. Now complaints DataFrame can easily be organized and plotted by company, product, resolution, and more.
